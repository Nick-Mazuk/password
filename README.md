##Premise
This passcode generator transcends all others. The passcode changes after every single input, making it virtually impossible to crack. And pure guessing gives a 1:10<sup>45</sup> chance of entering the correct passcode. So can you crack it?
##The Product
Each time, you are presented with 6 digits that are somewhat random. *Hint: If you figure out the non-random part, you have figured out the key to solving it.* Then, using the 6 digits as a hint, you are asked to input the correct passcode. If the passcode is correct, you are either extremely lucky or have figured out the key. If the passcode is incorrect, you are presented with a new set of 6 digits and the old hint, along with the old correct passcode, is provided for informational use only.
##How to Crack the Code
I won't tell you. But I will say that it will take more than 10 times to figure it out. Even looking at the source code for the product will not help. You will have to figure out how the hints are made before you have any chance of figuring out the passcode consistently.
